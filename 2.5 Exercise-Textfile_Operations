# In this exercise we were given a fragment of a play by Shakespear as a txt file ('Shakespeare.txt')
# The goal of this exercise was to write a program that opens the text file, 
# extract the number of words per line as well as the second word from each line
# The code should be general enough that it can handle other text files according to the same principle. 
# Assumptions: that such text files would contain between 1 and 1000 lines of text 
# and that each line of text would contain between 2 and 1000 words.


fyle = open('Shakespeare.txt')
l_fyle = fyle.readlines()
fyle.close
new_list = []
for i in l_fyle:
    new_list.append(i.split())
for i in new_list:
    zahl = 0
    for j in i:
        zahl += 1
    print(zahl, i[1])

# For the given example the output looks as followed:
# 10 in
# 9 would
# 8 than
# 8 prais'd
# 7 indiscretion
