# In this exercise we were given the task to write a program that, based on the 4 bases in DNA A, T, C and G 
# creates a list of codons (sets of 3 bases that code for amino acids)
# The list should only contain all the possible codons that contained one base twice but did not include 
# codons with 3 different bases or 3x the same base
# The print command simply shows us the 27th base from the generated list --> In this case TAA

basen = ['A', 'T', 'C', 'G']
codons = []
for base_1 in basen:
    for base_2 in basen:
        for base_3 in basen:
            if not (base_1 == base_2 and base_2 == base_3)and(base_1 == base_2 or base_2 == base_3 or base_3 == base_1):
                codons.append(base_1 + base_2 + base_3)
codons.sort()
print(codons[27])
