# In this exercise we were given two sequences of amino acids of two different proteins
# The goal was to write a program that shows us the longest shared sequence between both of these proteins 
# The program was to be general enough so the sequences could be exhanged for ANY protein, 
# and should still work even if the sequences did not have the same length
# Assumptions made: There is only one longest shared sequence & its length is always at least 1 amino acid
